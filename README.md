This repository stores every file related with the development of any project related to the Cibersecurity Engineering course.

## [Practica1](https://github.com/CLopMan/ciberseguridad-practicas/tree/main/practica1)
We were given access to a remote machine with the objective of retrieving 9 flags.

### **Tasks:**
- Cracking 3 passwords to obtain 3 flags embedded in executable files.
- Obtening permissions through password guessing to access ACL-protected files

### **Technologies used**: 
- ACL in linux, gdb, ghidra, bash, C, LaTEX.

We were given access to a remote machine with a proxy which intercepted two classes of flags.

### **Tasks:**
- Analyzing the data to discover the message.
- Describing why the proxy was able to work propperly.

### Technologies used:
- mitmproxy, `Python`, bash, LaTEX

## [Practica3](https://github.com/CLopMan/ciberseguridad-practicas/tree/main/practica3)
We were given two malwares and its source code in order to analyze them, checking they were the same program and retrieving a flag hidden within the software.

### Tasks:
- Analyzing two malwares and describe its behaivour.
- Discover a flag in each malware.
